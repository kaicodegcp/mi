Deploying Latest Microsoft PKI-Signed Certs to certs.parcel Across SDLC
Description

The EAP Engineering team successfully updated all SDLC environments with the latest Microsoft PKI-signed certificate chain files by integrating renewed .pem certs into the existing certs.parcel. These certificates were securely sourced from Citi’s internal Microsoft PKI portal
 and deployed using pre-existing Starfleet parcel automation.

This effort ensures all edge and CDS nodes consuming secure HiveServer2, Beeline, and other TLS-dependent services are aligned with the most recent internal certificate authority trust chain.

Key Achievements

Downloaded and verified Microsoft PKI-signed .pem chain files for CitiInternal CA.

Rebuilt the certs.parcel with updated chain for use in Beeline/Hive/Impala secured connections.

Leveraged existing parcel deployment automation to push the updated certs.parcel across all SDLC edge and CDS hosts.

Confirmed trust alignment by verifying TLS handshake success using Beeline CLI.

Benefits to the Team

Keeps CDS and Cloudera-based services in compliance with Citi's internal PKI lifecycle.

Eliminates risk of expired certificate usage by preemptively rotating CA chain.

Utilizes trusted and automated deployment workflow, avoiding manual errors.

Ensures consistent TLS validation across environments for all JDBC/ODBC clients.

Next Steps

Monitor upcoming cert expirations and automate .pem polling from PKI portal.

Extend this automation to include Java truststore regeneration as needed.

Notify app teams of cert rotation to enable downstream trust chain alignment.
