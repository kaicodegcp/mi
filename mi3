Description

CDS 1.5.5-SP1 Image Deployment to Docker Artifactory:
This week, the EAP Strategic Solutions team successfully deployed the latest Cloudera Data Services (CDS) 1.5.5-SP1 container images (version 1.5.5-h107) to the internal Docker Artifactory. This action ensures that the latest certified Cloudera OpenShift container images are now readily available for downstream CDS deployments across environments.

The images were validated, correctly tagged, and ingested into the Citi-hosted secure Docker registry to align with enterprise container distribution and audit standards.

Key Achievements

Successfully onboarded CDS 1.5.5-SP1 image set (tagged 1.5.5-h107) into Docker Artifactory.

Verified availability of all essential CDS components including:

Spark Operator

CDE Runtime Images

Vault/Certs helper images

CML base containers (if applicable)

Maintained consistent tagging conventions and metadata alignment for downstream automation compatibility.

Ensured image signatures and TLS trust validation passed for secure OpenShift cluster ingestion.

Benefits to the Team

Enables up-to-date, secure deployments of Cloudera Data Services using latest features and fixes from Cloudera 1.5.5-SP1 release.

Removes bottlenecks for environment teams by having pre-loaded and trusted CDS images in internal Docker repository.

Provides consistent, version-controlled access to validated images across all tiers (DEV, UAT, PROD).

Accelerates deployment timelines for new CDS instances on OpenShift by eliminating external fetch dependencies.

Next Steps

Coordinate with CDS deployment teams to schedule rollout of 1.5.5-SP1 to staging and production clusters.

Monitor for any platform-specific patch releases or updated base images for future Artifactory ingestion.

Automate future image ingestion and signature validation pipelines for ongoing CDS releases.
